# Digital-and-Analog-Communication
This repo holds projects I worked on that represent analog to digital communication theory.

Using primarily matlab and base arithmetic tool boxes we were tasked to dive into the concepts up electronic communication. These concepts ranged from fourier transform and sample rates to the bases behind true randomness that can be found in Additive White Gaussian Noise.

These concepts were taught through the use of B.P. Lathi and Zhi Dings [* *Modern Digital and Analog Communication Systems* *](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Communication-Electrical-Computer-Engineering/dp/0190686847/ref=asc_df_0190686847/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312126345020&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=938607077025791646&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9017002&hvtargid=pla-466802267701&psc=1).

## Project 1
Finding the fourier transform of a given equation and then power of signals

## Project 2

## Project 3
Additive Gaussian Noise
